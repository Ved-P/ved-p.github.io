## Undergraduate Learning Assistant -- *UCSB Computer Science Department*

I have served as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) for a total of three quarters. I ULA-ed for CS 138: Automata and Formal Languages in Spring 2025 and Fall 2025, and I am currently ULA-ing for CS 178: Introduction to Cryptography in Winter 2026. My responsibilities include holding office hours, collaborating with the teaching team to write problem sets, developing solution manuals, grading student work, and proctoring exams.

## Peer Advisor -- *UCSB Computer Science Department*

During my second year at UCSB, I worked in the CS academic advising office, conducting appointments with undergraduates to discuss course scheduling, graduation requirements, grad school applications, and other, similar topics. I also assisted department operations while responsibly handling sensitive student information in compliance with FERPA laws.

## Teaching Assistant -- *Dynamic Teaching*

*August 2019 to June 2023* <br>
*Cupertino, CA*

During high school, I TA-ed for Cupertino Math Olympiads, an afterschool math class for elementary and middle schoolers. I taught students in weekly classes, and I was named the Top TA for the 2022-2023 year for eliciting solutions to math questions with an engaging style. During the pandemic, I spearheaded the transition of the system to remote learning using Google Classroom. I also conducted private tutoring.
