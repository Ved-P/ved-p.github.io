# SWE Experience

## Associate Cybersecurity Engineer Intern -- *Visa*

*June 2026 to September 2026 (Expected)* <br>
*Foster City, CA*

I am happy to announce that I will be working at Visa this summer as an Associate Cybersecurity Engineer Intern!

## Software Engineering Intern -- *Intuitive Surgical*

*June 2025 to September 2025* <br>
*Sunnyvale, CA*

As a member of the Data Ingest and Delivery team at Intuitive, I evaluated and showcased Apache Iceberg as a scalable alternative to Elasticsearch for data query and visualization use cases. Throughout the internship, I implemented a robust pipeline to ingest data into Iceberg, queried via Snowflake. I leveraged Spark parallel computing to optimize ingest times by 84%. My project enabled two teams of data scientists to query our production datasets in a much more efficient and practical manner.

## Software Engineer Intern -- *1TCC*

*December 2023 to January 2024, July 2024 to September 2024* <br>
*Menlo Park, CA*

During my two internships at 1TCC, I designed an SHA-based user authentication service for an internal web application with an emphasis on user friendliness and readability; I also took the initiative to secure API Keys using environment variables. Additionally, I performed data analysis and ran extensive tests on invoices to calculate financial statistics for an international client.
