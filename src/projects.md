# Projects

## fuzz-bizz

*November 2025 to December 2025* <br>
*[github.com/fuzz-bizz/fuzz-bizz](https://github.com/fuzz-bizz/fuzz-bizz)*

As part of a group project, we implemented a Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) that leveraged AI to automate software vulnerability detection and patching in C projects. Our goal was to eliminate the need for human intervention in the security analysis workflow. I spearheaded the design and development of an agentic patching system built using Ollama and GPT-oss, drawing heavy inspiration from Trail of Bits’ Buttercup framework. This project was completed for CMPSC 279: Advanced Topics in Security at UC Santa Barbara.

## Quereum

*May 2024 to June 2024* <br>
*[github.com/ucsb-cs190J-Ledger-Legends/Quereum](https://github.com/ucsb-cs190J-Ledger-Legends/Quereum)*

As a team, we designed a smart contract application that utilizes Ethereum blockchain technology and Solidity to create a Q&A system that enables users to post questions and also allows the user to reward the best answers with ether. The system allows for interaction from other users to vote for the best answers, an incentive for other users to post good and thoughtful answers in order to get the reward. Our goals were to incentivize user participation while also maintaining security of user balances. My role included conducting extensive penetration testing to eliminate DeFi exploits such as re-entrancy and timestamp overflow. This project was made for CMPSC 190J: Blockchain Technology and Security at UCSB.

## webslinger

*February 2025* <br>
*[github.com/Ved-P/webslinger](https://github.com/Ved-P/webslinger)*

I designed a prototype for a desktop application that scans websites for common vulnerabilities as a first step in exploit detection and mitigation. The application was built using the Tauri framework. Although this application was very bare bones, it laid the foundations for the much more intelligent fuzz-bizz project.

## Blockchain Simulator

*March 2024* <br>
*[github.com/Ved-P/blockchain-sim](https://github.com/Ved-P/blockchain-sim)*

Another personal project of mine was to develop a Python module to analyze mining and forging speeds of Bitcoin-style blockchains and output relevant statistics.

## Market Safe

*July 2020* <br>
*[github.com/Ved-P/market-safe](https://github.com/Ved-P/market-safe)*

During the pandemic, I developed a web application using the Django framework that serves as an augmented contact tracing site. The website allows users to see AI reccomendations for which stores have had statistically fewer cases, and users can reserve a spot to go to that store. This project was submitted to &lt;hack&gt; Cupertino 2020.
