Hi there, hello! My name is Ved Pradhan, and I am a third-year student at UC Santa Barbara in the BS/MS program majoring in Computer Science. I am very passionate about cybersecurity and (post-)quantum cryptography, and I have multiple software engineering internships and CTF competition experiences under my belt (including winning the 2024 undergraduate division of iCTF!).

Outside of academics, I love playing board games and card games, reading mystery novels and spy thrillers, and listening to classical, cinematic, and barbershop music!
